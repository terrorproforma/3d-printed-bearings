# 3d-printed-bearings

## STEP file of bearing intended to be 3d printed
- ID: 15.2mm (after printing this typically shrinks to 15mm)
- ball: 2mm diameter stainless steel (obviously you'd need to get these yourself)


## Fusion360 file of bearing
so you can have any diameter bearing you need. 

The design uses th ID as the driving dimension which can be accessed via sketch 1. Adjusting this should automatically resize the bearing. You might also need to adjust the pattern on larger sizes so you have more balls in there - i haven't bothered to link this to the diameter yet.
